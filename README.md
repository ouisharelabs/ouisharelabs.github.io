OuiShare Labs Camp #2 Linked Profile (example)

###History

This is the first instance of Labs one-pager website created with GitHub Pages and manually updated in index.html, prior to Camp #2, online on labs.ouishare.net from February to April 2014.

In April 2014 we copied the content over to the drupal site. This stayed behind. @elf-pavlik picked it up as an already existing "Labs Camp #2 profile" but didn't get to linkifying the code yet.
